End users should not be left to enter hierarchical free-text information unassisted.

On the "Invite user"-form, invitee organization is such a field. We do not have a registry to pick organization/unit, so free-text is the only option. 

To make this free text more manageable, a service has been created that records all previous entries, and then allow fuzzy matching in a dropdown when entering new values.

This makes it easy to select a company name for an invited user if someone from the same company previously has been invited.
It also provides for the possibility to check auditing of company names.

This type of functionality needs an Ajax-enabled dropdown. To make it easy to take advantage of this service an ReST-service exposing this functionality has been created.
