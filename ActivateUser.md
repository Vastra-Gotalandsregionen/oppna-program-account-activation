# Introduction #

Activate User is done by **_the Invited User_**.

Before a user can activate him-/herself he/she must have been created and invited by a manager/sponsor. He/she will receive a email that contains an url to the page where the external user can activate him-/herself ("activate" principally means creating a password to be able to login). The resulting page will look like this:

After entering a valid password and submitting the user should be able to login to the specified system.

# Details #

It is also possible to use the "activation code" that is received in the invitation email by browsing to the Account Activation portlet. The screen should then look like this:

After entering the activation code the user may continue with the procedure described in the introduction.
