To facilitate this, Account Activation provides infrastructure services and portlet clients for:
  * Inviting collaborators
  * Activating the invited users account
  * Supervising invitations
  * Support for auditing invited collaborators
Everything in a secure and easy to use way.

Every organization has it's own infrastructure and way to to handle user information and log-in validation, so instead of mandating "One Way" of handling users, Account Activation provide plugin points for user creation and activation so that it is easy to integrate into the organizations existing way of doing things.

This allows Account Activation to focus on providing a workflow for invitations that are easy to use and maintain, yet secure and traceable.

This project contains client portlets and the account-activation infrastructure service.
The full solution need integration services to do creation and activation of the users.
